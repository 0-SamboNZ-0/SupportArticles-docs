## Determine the number of free and used Intune licenses

To view the number of free and used licenses on a Microsoft Intune subscription, run the following PowerShell commands:

1. From a PowerShell prompt, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   $creds = Get-Credential
   ```

2. A pop-up window will prompt for credentials. Enter your Microsoft Intune credentials.
3. Run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Connect-MsolService -Credential $creds
   ```

4. Run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Get-MsolAccountSku
   ```

A list of the **Account ID**, the **Active Units**, and the **Consumed Units** will appear. Note that this will also display any Microsoft Office 365 licenses on the subscription.
