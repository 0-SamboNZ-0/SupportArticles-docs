# 64-bit versions of Windows don't support 16-bit components, 16-bit processes, or 16-bit applications

This article discusses the lack of support for 16-bit components, 16-bit processes, or 16-bit applications in x64-based versions Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp;Window 10 â€“ all editions, Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;896458

## Summary

The x64-based versions of the Microsoft Windows Server 2003 operating systems and Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition don't support 16-bit programs, 16-bit processes, or 16-bit components. However, these 64-bit versions of Windows may recognize some 16-bit installers and automatically convert the 16-bit installer to a 32-bit installer.

## More information

To run a 16-bit program or a 32-bit program that uses 16-bit processes or 16-bit components, you must install the program on a 32-bit version of Windows. To run such a program, you can install a 32-bit version of Windows in a dual-boot configuration with the 64-bit version of Windows. Then, you can restart your computer to the 32-bit version of Windows and install the 16-bit program or 32-bit program that uses 16-bit processes or 16-bit components.

> [!NOTE]
> The 32-bit version of Windows must be installed on a separate disk volume or separate physical hard disk to function correctly. If you install a 32-bit version of Windows and a 64-bit version of Windows on the same disk volume, your computer may stop responding.

For more information about dual-boot configurations with 64-bit versions of Windows, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

[896455](https://support.microsoft.com/help/896455) Programs become unstable or do not start after you install a 64-bit version of Windows on the same partition as a 32-bit version of Windows  

> [!NOTE]
> You should upgrade critical 32-bit programs to a 64-bit version to take full advantage of the 64-bit hardware and the 64-bit version of Windows.

### Technical support for Windows x64 editions

Your hardware manufacturer provides technical support and assistance for Microsoft Windows x64 editions.
