# Use MSTSC or universal Remote Desktop client instead of RDMan in Windows 10

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows 10  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4512838

## Summary

Virtualization and remote desktops are an important part of your infrastructure and work. And, we recommend that you use in-box remote desktop client (MSTSC) or [universal Remote Desktop client](https://aka.ms/rdwin) instead of Remote Desktop Connection Manager (RDCMan).

## More information

We're increasing our investments in virtualization and remote desktops, such as Windows Virtual Desktop and RDS on Microsoft Azure. 
RDCMan is a client that is widely used to manage multiple remote desktop connections because it's a convenient option. However, RDCMan has not kept pace with the level of advanced technology that we're pursuing.
 Instead, we have two great supported client options: MSTSC and Universal Client for Windows 10. These clients offer increased security, and they are a key part of our engineering roadmap moving forward. In the future, you can expect even more capabilities, such as the ability to better manage multiple connections.
