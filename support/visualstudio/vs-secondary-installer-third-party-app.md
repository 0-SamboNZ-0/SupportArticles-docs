## Secondary Installer

Visual Studio 2015 installs a Secondary Installer that lets you install third-party applications. When Visual Studio 2015 or the Secondary Installer is uninstalled, the third-party applications that were installed may not be uninstalled. These third-party applications may have entries in **Add or Remove Programs** item in Control Panel.

For detailed information about the third-party applications that the Secondary Installer lets you deploy to your computer and instructions to uninstall them, see the following sections.

## Android NDK

The Android NDK doesn't have an entry in **Add or Remove Programs** item in Control Panel. It's installed locally in the following folder:  
`%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\Apps`

The Android NDK can be removed by removing the *android-ndk-r10* folder from the hard disk.

## Android Software Development Kit (SDK)

Android has an entry in **Add or Remove Programs** item in Control Panel and can be uninstalled from there.
