# List of Microsoft XML parser (MSXML) versions

This article describes versions of Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) that are available or installed by products or software updates.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; XML Core Services  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 269238

## Summary

This article lists the version numbers of MSXML or the XML parser. Different versions of MSXML are included with various products, such as Windows, Internet Explorer, Office, and SQL Server. MSXML is also updated when you install software updates for various products.

## Introduction

Microsoft provides several different XML parsers. The MSXML parser is included in the Msxml.dll file, the Msxml2.dll file, the Msxml3.dll file, the Msxml4.dll file, the Msxml5.dll file, the Msxml6.dll file, and one or more resource files.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows HTTP Services (Winhttp*.dll) is also included with some versions of MSXML.

The XML parser is a Component Object Model (COM) implementation of the W3C DOM model. Two versions are associated with each parser: the release version of the MSXML parser and the actual file version of the DLL that contains the parser. The release version of the MSXML parser (for example, versions 2.5, 2.6, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0) identifies the milestone of development.
