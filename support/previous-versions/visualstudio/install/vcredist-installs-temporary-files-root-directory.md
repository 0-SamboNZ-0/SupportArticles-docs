# VCRedist from VC++ 2008 installs temporary files in the root directory

This article helps you resolve the problem that VCredist installs files in the root directory instead of the temp directory.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Visual Studio 2008  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 950683

## Symptoms

When you install the Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (VCRedist_x86.exe, VCRedist_x64.exe, VCRedist_ia64.exe) for Visual Studio 2008 RTM, the following files are generated on the root directory of a drive that has the largest available space in the system:

- install.exe
- install.res.1028.dll
- install.res.1031.dll
- install.res.1033.dll
- install.res.1036.dll
- install.res.1040.dll
- install.res.1041.dll
- install.res.1042.dll
- install.res.2052.dll
- install.res.3082.dll
- vcredist.bmp
- globdata.ini
- install.ini
- eula.1028.txt
- eula.1031.txt
- eula.1033.txt
- eula.1036.txt
- eula.1040.txt
- eula.1041.txt
- eula.1042.txt
- eula.2052.txt
- eula.3082.txt
- VC_RED.MSI
- VC_RED.cab

## Cause

These temporary files are erroneously generated by the installer into the root directory of one of your drives, instead of the temp directory.

## Resolution

These files are unnecessary and can be safely deleted from the system. The functioning of the runtime library won't be affected by it.

It's a known bug and is fixed in VS2008 SP1.

It's a problem with a VCRedist for the RTM version of VS 2008. Developers should be using a later version. See [The latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003).

For example, for Visual Studio 2008, you should be using [Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package MFC Security Update](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=26368).
