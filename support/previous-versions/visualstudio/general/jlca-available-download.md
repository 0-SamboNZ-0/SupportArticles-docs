## Summary

The Microsoft Java Language Conversion Assistant (JLCA) is a tool that automatically converts existing Java-language source code to C# for developers who want to move their existing applications to the Microsoft .NET Framework. The Java Language Conversion Assistant provides the quickest low-cost method to move existing applications to C# on the .NET Framework. Developers can then extend their applications to produce and to exhaust Extensible Markup Language (XML) Web services, and then to take advantage of the benefits of the .NET developer environment, which includes ASP.NET, ADO.NET, and Windows Forms.

## Integration with Visual Studio .NET or Visual Studio 2005

The Java Language Conversion Assistant provides programming tool support through its integration with the award-winning Visual Studio .NET or Visual Studio 2005 integrated development environment (IDE). You can easily identify or complete continuing application development or migration tasks when you use the IDE.

## Protection for existing investments

When you convert your business logic, the Java Language Conversion Assistant helps you take advantage of your existing investment in business knowledge. This reduces the risk of new development while it reduces your time-to-market.

## Delivers full C# implementation

The Java Language Conversion Assistant converts existing Java-language source code to C#. The JLCA then directly uses the underlying .NET Framework. You can immediately use the power of the .NET Framework and the component-oriented programming features of C#.

Applications and services converted with the Java Language Conversion Assistant run only on the .NET Framework. They don't run on any Java Virtual machine. Microsoft developed the Java Language Conversion Assistant independently. It's not supported or approved by Sun Microsystems, Inc.
