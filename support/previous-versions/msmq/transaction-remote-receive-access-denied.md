# Access Denied when you perform transaction remote receive on Message Queuing 4.0 queue

This article helps to fix the **Access Denied** error that occurs when a transactional remote receive is performed on a Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) 4.0 queue in Windows Vista or in Windows Server 2008.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2654668

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You install MSMQ 4.0 on a computer that is running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008.
- You create a transactional Message Queuing queue on the computer.
- You run a client application that performs a transactional remote receive on the queue by using the exclusive access mode.

In this scenario, the client application intermittently receives an error message that resembles below:
> Access denied

> [!NOTE]
> This issue occurs even after you restart the application.

## Cause

This issue occurs because MSMQ does not remove the queue handles from the memory correctly when the client application performs the transactional remote receive.

Always refer to the **Applies To** section in articles to determine the actual operating system that each hotfix applies to.

  - The files that apply to a specific product, SR_Level (RTM, SP*n*), and service branch (LDR, GDR) can be identified by examining the file version numbers as shown in the following table.

    | Version                        | Product                               | SR_Level | Service branch |
