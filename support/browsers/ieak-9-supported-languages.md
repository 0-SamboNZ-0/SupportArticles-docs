# Supported languages for the Internet Explorer Administration Kit 9 packages

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; the Internet Explorer Administration Kit 9  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2555560


The [Internet Explorer Administration Kit (IEAK) 9](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=23643) now supports creating custom Internet Explorer 9 packages in a total of 93 languages. Because of a limitation in the IEAK 9 Wizard, the languages for IEAK 9 are divided into two sets and require two separate ieak.ini files. Not all 93 languages are supported on all platform and operating system configurations.

## More Information

The following tables list the languages for the supported platform and operating system configurations. The first table has the default set. The second table has the additional set. English US is available in both sets. Some of the languages will be available in late May 2011. Other languages aren't supported for creating custom browser packages on the platform and operating system configuration.

The default configuration of IEAK 9 can create customization packages for the languages in the default set. If packages are needed for languages in the additional set, you must replace the ieak.ini file. The ieak.ini files for the default set and additional set of languages are available here:

- Default set: [ieak.ini](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=219450)
- Additional set: [ieak.ini](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=219451)

To access the additional set of languages:

1. Download the ieak.ini file for the [additional set](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=219451) of languages. 
   
2. Replace the default ieak.ini file in the following directory:   
     For x86 platforms:  C:\Program Files\Windows IEAK 9\  
     For x64 platforms:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows IEAK 9\

> [!NOTE] 
> If you only need access to the default set of languages, you do not have to download and replace the ieak.ini file. The default ieak.ini is only needed if you already replaced the original ieak.ini to access the additional set of languages and you want to return to the default set of languages.
