- Clean-boot VMs (disable all non-Microsoft services and then reboot)
- Ghosted network adapter removal
- Boot an Azure VM domain controller into Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM)
- Identify Azure VM and Azure platform storage and disk configuration issues that can cause disk performance issues
- Remotely install the Azure VM Guest Agent
- Try to establish a remote PowerShell session to Azure VMs
- Perform system recovery operations by using a recovery VM when Azure VMs are in a no-boot or boot-looping state
