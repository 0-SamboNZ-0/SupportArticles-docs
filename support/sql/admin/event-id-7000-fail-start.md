# Event ID 7000 and SQL Server doesn't start

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; SQL Server

## Symptoms

When the Microsoft SQL Server binary file (Sqlservr.exe) is renamed on the system thatâ€™s hosting the SQL Server service, the service doesn't start, and you receive the following error message, depending on how you try to start the service:

- By using the Services applet:
  
    > Windows could not start the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service on Local Computer.  
      Error 2: The system cannot find the file specified.

- By using a command prompt:

    > System error 2 has occurred.  
      The system cannot find the file specified.

## Resolution

    ```

1. Go to the SQL Server [installation folder](/sql/sql-server/install/file-locations-for-default-and-named-instances-of-sql-server) and verify that it doesn't contain the Sqlservr.exe file.

1. Resolve the issue by repairing the SQL Server installation per the procedure that's documented in [Repair a Failed SQL Server Installation](/sql/database-engine/install-windows/repair-a-failed-sql-server-installation).
