# Welcome to Support articles for SQL Server

The articles in the table of contents (TOC) provide support for Microsoft SQL Server and closely related products. The articles discuss items such as the following:

- The precise meaning of a particular error message. And what you can do to solve the problem.
- Strategies for identifying why the speed performance of your SQL Server might have decreased recently after application updates.
- Information about available service packs or cumulative updates that you can install.
- Techniques for solving data problems, such as how to remove duplicate rows from a table.
- And much more.

Many of these Support articles are what Microsoft informally calls _Knowledge Base_ (KB) articles.
